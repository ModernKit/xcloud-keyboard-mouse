        <h3 id="disputes">12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>

        <p><strong>Informal Negotiations</strong></p>

        <p>
          To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a
          "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the
          "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
          informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
          notice from one Party to the other Party.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>

        <p>
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
          extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
          authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
          is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
          public or any other persons.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</strong></p>

        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
          binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
          intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
          invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
          illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
          provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
          within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that

          constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
