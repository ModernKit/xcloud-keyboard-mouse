      <h3 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our
          Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process
          your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>

      <p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our

      </ul>

      <h3 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p><em><strong>In Short:&nbsp;</strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and
          we have a valid legal reason (i.e.,&nbsp;legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to
          comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;our contractual obligations, to
          protect your rights, or to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
          necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
          fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes
          described in order to:</li>
        <li>Analyze&nbsp;how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
        <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
        <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
          for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
          agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
          we are involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong>&nbsp;We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
          protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
          threats to the safety of any person.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this
          section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>

      <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong>&nbsp;We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
          negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business
          to another company.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="cookies">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and
          store your information.</em></p>

      <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information in an anonymized fashion.</p>

      <h3 id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary
          to&nbsp;fulfill&nbsp;the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
        requirements).&nbsp;No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
        than&nbsp;the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

      <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
        or&nbsp;anonymize&nbsp;such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
        has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

      <h3 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system
          of&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;and technical security measures.</em></p>

          <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;security measures designed to
        protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
        your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from
        our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

      <h3 id="infominors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

      <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We do not knowingly collect data from or market to&nbsp;children under
          18 years of age.</em></p>

      <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
        dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
        been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
        records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us
        at&nbsp;david.idol@gmail.com.</p>

      <h3 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
        or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;and implementing DNT
        signals has been&nbsp;finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
        that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      </p>
